# Plan

## Goal

* Reduce HTTP requests on the main web site call by offloading to a single request to a smart NODE server.

## Merge Async Requests

* Facebook and Twitter requests for 'like' counts are simple to fetch, but require either multiple http requests or extra load via FB javascript library
* Avoid this by taking combined set of urls, use caching on a service (this app) to fetch urls and counts, and return like quantities.
* Profit.

## Event based

* Take JSONP and return a method type response that inserts/provides the like values.
