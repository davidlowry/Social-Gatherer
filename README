# Plan

## Merge Async Requests

* Facebook and Twitter requests for 'like' counts are simple to fetch, but require either multiple http requests or extra load via FB javascript library
* Avoid this by taking combined set of urls, use caching on a service (this app) to fetch urls and counts, and return like quantities.
* Profit.
